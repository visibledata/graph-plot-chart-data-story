These colours have been added into the {gpcsdTools} package, however they're liable to change in the future - I'll update this post with footnotes should that happen.\n\nHere are the original colours:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe \"main\" and \"triad alt\" categories give us 10 colours of different hues we can *theoretically* use in a single chart. Here's an example chart \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<img src='images/gg_partyid_10_colours.png' width='100%'/>\n\nUsing the {colorblindr} package to simulate the most common form of colour blindness (deuteranomaly) we see the palette still performs surprisingly well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<img src='images/gg_deu_sim.jpg' width='100%'/>\n\n\n\n\n\n",
