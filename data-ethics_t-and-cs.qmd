# Data Ethics

> All tech is political. From the metal extracted to run code, the authors writing code and the power generated to cool the metal. Raise that by magnitudes for data.

You'll find information about both our data ethics and social policies here.

## GenAI Policy

GenAI tools should not be used casually without understanding the deep ethical impacts of the energy use of GenAI, copyright infringement and what it means for creativity.

> We fully support and understand that many of our clients have benefited from all sorts of generative tools. Individuals and companies have the freedom to exercise lifestyle choices the way they see fit.

- We refuse to use image generation tools for throw away content. The energy impact of generating an image used on a single slide is not justifiable - for us it is equivalent to disposable e-waste.

- We do not use **any** GenAI tools with clients data, information or ideas without a client specifically requesting them.

- We refuse to use **any** generative images without disclosing their origin.

- We refuse to use GenAI tools for idea generation without disclosing their use, and do not **begin** with GenAI.

- We exercise restraint in the use of generative coding tools. It would be *silly* to refuse to use command completion, auto-correct and other common IDE features. Similarly, refusing to engage with any generative code tools feels reactive. However, vibe coding doesn't align with our desire to truly understand the work and data that we interact with.
