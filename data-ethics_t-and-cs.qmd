# Data Ethics

## GenAI Policy

GenAI tools should not be used casually without understanding the deep ethical impacts of the energy use of GenAI, copyright infringement and what it means for creativity.

> We fully understand that many of our clients have benefited from all sorts of generative tools. Individuals and companies have the freedom to exercise lifestyle choices the way they see fit.

- **Memes over slop**.<br/>
We refuse to use GenAI tools for single use images, it's equivalent to single use e-waste. Memes are wonderful, silly and evidence of human community.</br>
GenAI images will always be clearly marked when we are aware of their provenance.

- **Creativity over unattributed rehashing**<br/>
Forgetting for a moment that they hallucinate, GenAI tools do not help you understand we stand on the shoulders of giants and that.

- We do not use **any** GenAI tools with clients data, information or ideas without a client specifically requesting them.

- We refuse to use **any** generative images without disclosing their origin.

- We refuse to use GenAI tools for idea generation without disclosing their use, and do not **begin** with GenAI.

- We exercise restraint in the use of generative coding tools. It would be *silly* to refuse to use command completion, auto-correct and other common IDE features. Similarly, refusing to engage with any generative code tools feels reactive. However, vibe coding doesn't align with our desire to truly understand the work and data that we interact with.

We do not tolerate harassment of other participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from courses and/or workshops they are signed up for without a refund.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, and unwelcome sexual attention.
