# What we do

We specialise in three areas:

- **Workshops not webinars**.<br/>There's nothing we love more than an audience-driven, hands-on workshop where we can do live data work so you leave with new knowledge and skills that are directly relevant to you. Come along, they're fun.

- **Bootcamps without agnosticism**<br/>
Our dataviz bootcamps are explicitly bound to a data visualisation tool. We equip you to get your hands dirty with data, the graphical representaton of data and storytelling. This is not tool agnostic advice.

- **Coaching and consulting**<br/>
Need a push, help in hand or for us to build something for you? With over a decade's experience with our toolkit we know that we can get you to where you need to be. This might include referring you to our partners in the wider data visualisation or programmaing community.

# Who do we work with?

We work with data professionals from all walks of life, across industry the charity sector and academia. 

We are best suited for folks who (at least occassionally) get their hands dirty with data. There are storytelling studios that might be better suited for data leaders who are far removed from their wrangling and tech stack - if we feel your needs are better supported by other agencies we will gladly recommend them.

# Who are we?

At the moment our studio is run end-to-end by Charlotte Hadley - our founder and instructor. We're working on growing our team in 2026!
