    "text": "At GPCDS we’re purposefully provoking comparisons to things. To evoke the feeling that everything needed to be categorised and factions exist we wanted to design a cohesive colour palette that gels well but also has clear distinctions within it. Let’s meet the GPCDS palette, brand idents and the logomarks.\n\n\n\nOur initial sketches for brand elements back in 2023.\n\nThe colours\nThe primary colours of each category were chosen through the excellent interactive tool https://coolors.co/generate and then the other colours were generated through experimenting with https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel. While iterating on the palette we continuously simulated the colours under the most common form of colour blindness - deuteranopia. The chart below shows these 25 colours:\n\n\n\nThere are 7 additional colours, primarily designed for web elements but could also be used alongside the visualisation category palettes.\n\n\n\nRAG indicators are problematic but very popular. Our palette contains 5 colour-blind safe colours from a red-green palette recommended via Andy Kirk’s Visualising Data from this beautiful NPR chart by Alyson Hurt and Katie Park.\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Idents\nEach visualisation category has two “idents” - a major and minor ident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Element\nMajor Ident\nMinor Ident\n\n\n\n\nFilled square\nEach ident is a 1:1 rectangle filled in the primary colour for the category.\n\n\n\nDisks\nEach ident contains four disks, two in the secondary colour and the other two in the tertiary colour from the category\nEach ident contains two disks, using the secondary and tertiary colour from the category\n\n\nLines\nEach ident contains one or more lines using the tertiary darker colour from the category\nEach ident may contain a line using the teriary darker colour from the category\n\n\nText\nEach ident contains the number of the category using the Futura font\nMinor idents don’t contain text\n\n\n\nThese are the properties of the graphical elments:\n\nident_linewidth &lt;- 5\nident_disk_size &lt;- 25\nident_textsize &lt;- 40\nident_minor_disk_factor &lt;- sqrt(5)\nident_font &lt;- \"Futura\"\n\nAs the idents are intended to be displayed in their “four-wise arrangement” they were individually designed to make that layout satisfying. There are notes below about how these decisions were made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph idents are simple graphs.

There are three different versions of the design:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two cricisms of the first generation logomarks:\n\nIn the colour logomark the arrows in the story section do not have a lineend on the non-arrow size. This is a limitation of the curve geom.\nThere are slight inconsistencies in the linewidth of some elements due to how they’re calculated in {ggplot2}. In an ideal world all lines would have the same width.\n\n\n\nLettermark\nOur combination mark was designed before the lettermark in Canva:\n\nWe’ve tried to replicate the lettermark directly here with HTML and CSS but unfortunately cannot get the font-weight to affect the letters:\n\nG|P|C|DS\n\n\n\nCombination Marks\nThe combination marks were constructed in Canva for simplicity. To provide some meaning to how the lettermark and logomark relate to one another the height of the pipe character has been set to 150px and the logomark is 2 * ϕ * 150px\nThe 1:1 and 4:3 ratio combination marks are crops of the same image with a vertical alignment, whereas the 16:9 combination mark is horizontally arranged:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavicon\nFavicons are miniture versions of the logo used for website icon etc, the logomark has been simplified to rectangles coloured with the primary colour of each visualisation category."

We covered a mass of material, without it seeming overwhelming.\n\nData Scientist, Insurance Industry\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie’s enthusiasm & passion for all things R, are hard not to get caught up in. I will look forward to reading blogs by Charlie and hopefully attending more trainings in the future.\n\nBenjamin Sutton, Brit Insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much Charlie! I’m really impressed with the quality of this course, and I’ll be referring back to certain videos/topics as they come up in my geospatial journey ;) Thanks again!\n\nData Scientist, Fishing Industry\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for all the help! I feel like searching the internet for help with R is like looking for a very specific needle across a giant field of haystacks, and you both are the metal detectors that get us where we need to be more quickly.\n\nTechnical Director, Tropical Health\n\n\n\n\n\nI thank you for the last feedback, I loved it because now I can change the style with css, which I had no idea about. You are a sweetheart, because when I listen to your video I feel light and at peace!\n\nResearcher, Plant Science"

Initially I was primarily responsible for developing and delivering customer-personalised technical demonstrations of Mathematica, including at C-level meetings. I also revamped several of the commercial training courses, and taught on the CQF program. Towards the end of my employment I was a senior consultant working on-site to build products for customers."
