title: "Workshops not webinars"
toc: true

We love running engaging, audience-driven workshops that include live data work and a focus on the experience - not recycling the same dry content. These are not sales funnel webinars. 

Come learn, have fun and leave equipped with new knowledge and skills.

Thank you for all the help! I feel like searching the internet for help with R is like looking for a very specific needle across a giant field of haystacks, and you both are the metal detectors that get us where we need to be more quickly.

### Hey - I'm Charlie! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I've been coaching, training and working hands-on in data visualisation and storytelling since 2012.

I'm a proudly certified and commercially successful data coach, and I've built the data-focused train the trainer program for the multiple award winning Data & AI Academy at Admiral.

Nothing is more important to me more than meeting my learners and customers where **you** are. It doesn't matter what your tech, data or visualisation fluency is. I love finding what matters to you and building from there.
